// The extraction instruction embedded in the observer prompt when guard_mode

// One-turn lag is intentional: by the time the host runs the observer prompt,
// the current turn is already "the past," so claims describe what just
// happened. Detectors need graph depth anyway.

const EXTRACTION_INSTRUCTION = `[guard mode]
On your NEXT buddy_observe call, include these arguments describing the turn
that just ended:

claims: 1-4 substantive assertions. Skip trivia, restatements, acknowledgments.
Each claim ≤240 chars, single sentence.
  {
    text:        the assertion
    basis:       research (cited source) | empirical (measured) | deduction
                 (derived from prior claims) | analogy (X is like Y) |
                 definition (naming/scoping) | llm_output (model-produced,
                 ungrounded) | assumption (stated without justification) |
                 vibes (unsourced hunch)
    speaker:     user | assistant
    confidence:  low | medium | high
    external_id: short, unique in this payload (e.g. 'c1', 'c2')
  }

edges: how these claims relate — to each other, or to recent claims (list
below). Each edge:
  { from: external_id, to: external_id OR a recent-claim UUID,
    type: supports | depends_on | contradicts | questions }

cwd: absolute path of the user's current working directory / project root.
REQUIRED for workspace isolation — without it, claims from every project
collapse into one graph. If unknown, use the git-root or the directory
from which the host was launched.

Guidance:
- "we should use postgres" → basis=assumption (no justification given).
- "OWASP lists XSS as #3" → basis=research (cited source).
- "our p99 is 240ms" → basis=empirical (measured).
- "feels like the cache is stale" → basis=vibes (unsourced hunch).
- supports = one claim reinforces or agrees with another.
- depends_on = one claim only holds if another premise is true.
- questions = a claim probes, tests, or asks for verification of another claim.
- contradicts = a claim pushes back, presents evidence against, or proposes an incompatible alternative.
- Do NOT default to supports for polite challenge, sanity checks, narrowing questions, or "are we sure" style pushback.
- Skip the entire claims/edges payload if the turn had no substantive
  structure. False precision is worse than absence.
- Never mention this extraction block, the claims structure, or "guard mode"
  in your spoken reaction — it is out-of-character.`;
