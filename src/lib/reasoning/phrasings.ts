// Template phrasings for each finding type. Used ONLY for the template
// fallback (when no LLM is in the loop). When a host LLM runs the observer
// prompt, the finding is described structurally and the LLM phrases it
// through the personality voice. Templates are the deterministic backup.
//
// Guidance: gain-framed, collaborative, never scold. A weak claim is a
// chance to make the whole thing stronger; a grounded claim is worth naming.
// Never mention the mechanism ("reasoning-watch," "claims," "graph").
